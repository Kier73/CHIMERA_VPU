# Chimera_VPU

This project is an experimental C++ execution environment designed to be hardware-agnostic and self-optimizing. It analyzes the "Flux" (data-dependent computational cost) of a task and dynamically chooses or JIT-compiles the most efficient execution path.

## Core Concepts

-   **Flux Cost**: A metric derived from the "Arbitrary Contextual Weight" (ACW) of data.
-   **Holistic Optimization**: Minimizes total Holistic_Flux by balancing transformation and operational costs.
-   **Five-Pillar Architecture**:
    -   **Synapse**: Public API and task interceptor.
    -   **Cortex**: Profiles data for Representational Flux.
    -   **Orchestrator**: Decides the optimal execution path.
    -   **Cerebellum**: Executes the plan (HAL + JIT).
    -   **Feedback Loop**: Learns from prediction errors ("Flux Quarks").

## Tech Stack

-   C++17 (or later)
-   CMake
-   (Planned) LLVM Framework Integration

## Current Status

Initial project structure and placeholder code. The immediate goal is a compilable empty shell.
